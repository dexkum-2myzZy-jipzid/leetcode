## LeetCode Solutions

Personal collection of LeetCode problem solutions and reusable algorithm snippets.

### Folders
- `LeetCode/` problem directories: `number.Title/`
- `DataStructureAndAlgo/` core data structures & algorithm templates
- `Note/` quick notes / cheat sheets

### How to Use
Search by problem number in `LeetCode/`. 

Reuse templates from `DataStructureAndAlgo/`. 

Read notes in `Note/` when forgetting details.

### Conventions
- One folder per problem.
- Multiple approaches kept together (BFS vs DFS, iterative vs recursive).
- Top comments: idea + time/space.

### Goal
Clear, tested, comparable solutions. Improve readability first.

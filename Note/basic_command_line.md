# Basic Command Line

Sure! Here are some basic command-line operations you can perform on macOS:

1. **Navigating Directories (`cd`)**:
   - `cd directory_name`: Change the current working directory to the specified directory.
   - `cd ..`: Move up one directory level.
   - `cd ~`: Move to your home directory.
   - `cd /`: Move to the root directory.

2. **Listing Files and Directories (`ls`)**:
   - `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.
   - `ls -l`: List files and directories in long format, providing additional details like permissions, owner, size, and modification date.
   - `ls -a`: List all files and directories, including hidden ones (those starting with a dot).

3. **Creating Files and Directories (`touch`, `mkdir`)**:
   - `touch filename`: Create an empty file with the specified name.
   - `mkdir directory_name`: Create a new directory with the specified name.

4. **Removing Files and Directories (`rm`, `rmdir`)**:
   - `rm filename`: Remove (delete) the specified file. Be careful with this command as it permanently deletes files.
   - `rm -r directory_name`: Remove a directory and its contents recursively. Use this with caution as it can't be undone.
   - `rmdir directory_name`: Remove an empty directory. It won't work if the directory has contents.

5. **Copying Files and Directories (`cp`)**:
   - `cp source_file destination_file`: Copy a file to a specified location.
   - `cp -r source_directory destination_directory`: Copy a directory and its contents recursively to a specified location.

6. **Moving or Renaming Files and Directories (`mv`)**:
   - `mv source_file destination_file`: Move or rename a file.
   - `mv source_directory destination_directory`: Move or rename a directory.

7. **Displaying File Contents (`cat`, `less`)**:
   - `cat filename`: Display the contents of a file.
   - `less filename`: View the contents of a file one page at a time. Press the spacebar to move forward and press "q" to quit.

These are some of the basic command-line operations on macOS. Practice using these commands to become more familiar with the terminal environment. Remember to exercise caution, especially when dealing with commands like `rm` and `mv`, as they can have permanent consequences.
